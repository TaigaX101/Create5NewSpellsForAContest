# Create5NewSpellsForAContest
I have to create 5 new spells for the magic plugin to win a contest so I can get Head-Admin I dont want the rank but I will be more then happy to be promoted idc about some stupid rank but its a fun contest and I can learn new things 
If I win I will cry in happieness but if I dont then gg like I said Idc about some stupid rank I am happy with the rank I got I just want to participate
In a little contest that my 2 friends are doing to get Head-Admin I dont want it but they really do so I thought it would be fun to join in
if I succeed will be happy because I never done this before but I am learning and I think this will be a fun plugin to learn about.
